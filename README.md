Orion's Advanced Engines Pack for Spaceflight Simulator

Hi, and welcome to AEP! This document contains everything you need to know about this pack.

Download:
Step 1: download the .pack file
Step 2: paste the .pack file into the SFS parts folder, located in the mods folder in your game files
Step 3: load the game, and execute a realistic crewed Saturn mission (Optional, but cool.)

Parts:
This pack contains 6 different engines, all with their own specs and niches. All these engines are designed for realistic mode, but they should work well for realistic and normal. Each engine also has its own fuel requirments, eg. LH2 for the NERVA RNS and Xenon for the NEXT thruster. All the engines and fuel tanks can be found in the AEP folder in the parts menu.
