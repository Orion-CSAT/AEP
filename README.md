Step 2: Paste the .pack file into the SFS parts folder, located in the Custom Assets folder in your game files

# Parts
This pack contains 6 different engines, all with their own specs and niches. All these engines are designed for realistic mode, but they should work well for realistic and normal. Each engine also has its own fuel requirments, eg. LH2 for the NERVA RNS and Xenon for the NEXT thruster. All the engines and fuel tanks can be found in the AEP folder in the parts menu.
